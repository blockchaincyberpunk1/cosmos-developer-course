Security Audit Report

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will be provided with the codebase of a Cosmos-based blockchain application. Their task is to conduct a thorough security audit of the codebase, identifying vulnerabilities and proposing recommended fixes. This exercise enables students to apply their knowledge of blockchain security principles and practices in a real-world context.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Security Audit (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of security audits in blockchain development and the critical role of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
Task 2: Security Audit (3 - 4 hours)
2. Provide students with the codebase of a Cosmos-based blockchain application. Ensure that the codebase contains realistic security vulnerabilities (you may include common issues such as input validation, access control, or data sanitization vulnerabilities).

Audit Process (60%):

Instruct students to thoroughly review the codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Document the identified vulnerabilities, providing clear descriptions and evidence.
Categorize vulnerabilities based on their severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).
Offer detailed explanations of how each vulnerability could be exploited and the potential impact.
Recommended Fixes (30%):

Propose recommended fixes or improvements for each identified vulnerability.
Include code snippets or pseudocode to illustrate the suggested changes.
Explain how the fixes address the vulnerabilities and enhance security.
Report Documentation (10%):

Ensure that the security audit report is well-organized and includes clear documentation of findings and recommendations.
Task 3: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to submit their completed security audit report, including the identified vulnerabilities, recommended fixes, and report documentation.

Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their security audit reports for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their security audit reports.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized security audit reports.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness and accuracy of vulnerability identification.
Quality of recommended fixes and explanations.
Clarity and organization of the security audit report.
