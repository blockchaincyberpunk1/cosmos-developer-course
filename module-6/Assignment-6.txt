Test Automation Implementation

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will be challenged to implement automated tests for a provided Cosmos-based blockchain application. Their task is to write test scripts and execute them using a chosen testing framework. This exercise enables students to gain hands-on experience with test automation and ensure the reliability of blockchain applications.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Test Automation Implementation (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of test automation in ensuring the quality and reliability of blockchain applications.
Task 2: Test Automation Setup (30 minutes - 1 hour)
2. Provide students with a Cosmos-based blockchain application for which they will create automated tests.

Instruct students to set up the necessary development environment, including the chosen testing framework and any required dependencies.
Task 3: Test Script Development (2 - 3 hours)
4. Challenge students to write automated test scripts for various functionalities or components of the provided blockchain application. The test scripts should include the following components:

Test Scenario Description (15%):

Provide a brief description of the test scenario being addressed by the test script.
Test Steps (50%):

Write the sequence of test steps to be executed in the test script.
Include actions, inputs, and expected outcomes for each step.
Emphasize thorough test coverage.
Assertions and Validations (25%):

Define assertions or validations to confirm the correctness of the application's behavior during testing.
Ensure that the test scripts verify expected results.
Cleanup (10%):

Include any cleanup steps necessary to reset the environment after testing.
Task 4: Test Execution (1 - 2 hours)
5. Instruct students to execute the automated test scripts against the provided blockchain application.

Encourage students to analyze the test results and report any issues or failures.
Task 5: Documentation and Reporting (30 minutes - 1 hour)
7. Require students to document their test automation process, including:

Details of the test scripts created.
Execution results, including any failures or issues encountered.
Steps taken to resolve issues or failures.
Task 6: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
8. Ask students to submit their completed test automation scripts, test execution results, and documentation.

Task 7: Peer Review (1 hour)
9. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their test automation scripts, execution results, and documentation for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 8: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
10. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their test automation scripts and documentation.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized test automation scripts, test execution results, and documentation.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the test automation scripts.
Clarity and organization of documentation.
Effectiveness of test execution and issue reporting.
