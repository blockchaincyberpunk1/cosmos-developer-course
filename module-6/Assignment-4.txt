Task 3: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to submit their completed security incident response plan, ensuring that it covers all the required components.

Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their security incident response plans for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their security incident response plans.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized security incident response plans.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the security incident response plan.
Clarity and organization of the plan's components.
