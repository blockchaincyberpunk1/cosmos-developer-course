Security Best Practices Documentation

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will research and document security best practices specific to Cosmos-based blockchain development. Their task is to compile a comprehensive guide covering both consensus and application security. This exercise empowers students with essential knowledge and practical guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of blockchain systems.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Security Best Practices Documentation (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of security in blockchain development and the significance of following best practices to protect blockchain systems.
Task 2: Research and Compilation (4 - 5 hours)
2. Challenge students to conduct thorough research on security best practices related to Cosmos-based blockchain development, focusing on both consensus and application security. They should consider the following aspects:

Consensus Security (50%):

Research and document best practices related to the security of the consensus algorithm used in Cosmos (e.g., Tendermint).
Cover topics such as validator node security, slashing prevention, and network-level security.
Application Security (50%):

Research and document best practices for ensuring the security of blockchain applications built on Cosmos.
Include guidelines for secure smart contract development, data protection, and user authentication.
Documentation (10%):

Ensure that the security best practices guide is well-documented and organized.
Use clear explanations and provide practical examples when necessary.
Task 3: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to submit their completed security best practices documentation, which should include guidelines for both consensus and application security.

Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their documentation for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their security best practices documentation.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized security best practices documentation.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the documentation for consensus and application security.
Clarity and organization of the guide.
Quality of explanations and practical examples provided.
