Governance Proposal Draft

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will draft their own on-chain governance proposals for their blockchain applications. They will create comprehensive proposals that include technical details and a governance plan. These proposals will serve as the foundation for future in-class simulations or discussions, allowing students to apply their knowledge of governance mechanisms.
