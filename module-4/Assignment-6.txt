Networking Layer Evaluation

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will evaluate the performance and security aspects of Tendermint's networking layer based on real-world data and incidents. They will analyze and present their findings in a report format, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the networking layer in a practical context.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Networking Layer Evaluation (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of evaluating the performance and security aspects of networking layers in blockchain systems. Explain how real-world data and incidents provide valuable insights.
Task 2: Data Collection and Analysis (2 - 3 hours)
2. Instruct students to collect and analyze real-world data and incidents related to Tendermint's networking layer. They should focus on the following aspects:

Performance Assessment (40%):

Evaluate the network's performance based on metrics like transaction throughput, latency, and scalability.
Analyze how the networking layer has performed under varying network loads or during specific events (e.g., network upgrades).
Security Assessment (40%):

Investigate security incidents or vulnerabilities that may have occurred in the past related to Tendermint's networking layer.
Assess the effectiveness of security measures and their impact on network security.
Findings and Recommendations (20%):

Summarize key findings from the performance and security assessments.
Provide recommendations for enhancing performance or security based on the evaluation results.
Task 3: Report Writing (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to compile their evaluation findings into a comprehensive report. Reports should include:

Introduction (10%):

Provide an introduction to the topic and the purpose of the report.
Performance Assessment (40%):

Present findings from the performance assessment of Tendermint's networking layer.
Security Assessment (40%):

Discuss security incidents, vulnerabilities, and security measures related to the networking layer.
Findings and Recommendations (10%):

Summarize key findings and provide recommendations for improvement.
Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their evaluation reports for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their evaluation reports.
