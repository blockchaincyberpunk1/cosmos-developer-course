Networking Models Research

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will research and compare various networking models used in blockchain systems, including the Gossip protocol, Kafka-based messaging, and Tendermint's approach. They will delve into technical details, strengths, and weaknesses of each networking model to gain a deeper understanding of their role in blockchain technology.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Networking Models (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the concept of networking models in blockchain systems and their significance in maintaining a distributed and secure network.
Task 2: Model Selection (15 minutes)
2. Instruct students to select and focus on one of the following networking models: Gossip protocol, Kafka-based messaging, or Tendermint's approach. They should choose the model they find most interesting or relevant.

Task 3: Technical Details Analysis (1.5 - 2.5 hours)
3. Ask students to conduct a technical analysis of the selected networking model. They should explore and compare the following aspects:

Technical Principles (40%):

Describe the technical principles and mechanisms that underpin the selected networking model.
Explain how the model facilitates communication and data propagation within a blockchain network.
Strengths (30%):

Identify and discuss the strengths and advantages of the selected networking model.
Provide examples or case studies where the model has performed well.
Weaknesses (30%):

Identify and analyze the weaknesses or limitations of the selected networking model.
Highlight potential challenges or drawbacks that may arise in certain scenarios.
Task 4: Comparison (30 minutes - 1 hour)
4. After researching the selected networking model in depth, ask students to compare it with other networking models used in blockchain systems (e.g., comparing Gossip protocol with Kafka-based messaging or Tendermint's approach). They should consider technical aspects, strengths, and weaknesses in their comparisons.

Task 5: Report Writing (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Require students to compile their research findings and comparisons into a comprehensive report. Reports should include:

Introduction (10%):

Provide an introduction to the topic and the purpose of the research.
Technical Details Analysis (40%):

Present findings from the technical analysis of the selected networking model.
Comparison (30%):

Compare the selected networking model with other blockchain networking models.
Conclusion (20%):

Summarize the key points of the research and offer conclusions on the strengths and weaknesses of the selected networking model.
Task 6: Peer Review (1 hour)
6. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their research reports for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 7: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
7. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their research reports.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized research reports.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Depth and accuracy of the technical analysis.
Clarity and organization of the research report.
Thoughtfulness in presenting technical details, strengths, and weaknesses.
