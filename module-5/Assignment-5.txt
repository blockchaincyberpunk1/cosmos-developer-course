Cross-Chain Application Design

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to design a detailed cross-chain blockchain application that leverages the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol for a specific use case. They will be tasked with providing comprehensive design elements, including architecture diagrams, use case descriptions, and a plan for integrating IBC. This exercise encourages students to apply their knowledge of blockchain interoperability in a practical context.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Cross-Chain Application Design (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of designing cross-chain blockchain applications and how IBC can be utilized for seamless communication between blockchains.
Task 2: Use Case Selection (15 minutes)
2. Instruct students to select a specific use case for their cross-chain application. The use case should be practical and relevant to blockchain technology.

Task 3: Cross-Chain Application Design (4 - 5 hours)
3. Challenge students to design a cross-chain blockchain application based on the following elements:

Use Case Description (20%):

Provide a detailed description of the selected use case and its significance in the context of blockchain technology.
Architecture Diagram (30%):

Create a comprehensive architecture diagram illustrating the components and interactions of the cross-chain application.
Clearly identify the blockchains involved and their roles.
IBC Integration Plan (30%):

Develop a step-by-step plan for integrating the IBC protocol into the application.
Describe how IBC will facilitate communication between the blockchains.
Benefits and Innovations (20%):

Discuss the benefits and potential innovations that the cross-chain application brings to the chosen use case and the blockchain ecosystem.
Task 4: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
4. Ask students to submit their completed cross-chain application design, including the use case description, architecture diagram, IBC integration plan, and benefits/innovations discussion.

Task 5: Peer Review (1 hour)
5. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their cross-chain application designs for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 6: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
6. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their cross-chain application designs.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized cross-chain application designs, including all required elements.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Clarity and relevance of the use case description.
Completeness and accuracy of the architecture diagram.
Feasibility and effectiveness of the IBC integration plan.
Thoughtfulness of benefits and innovations discussion.
