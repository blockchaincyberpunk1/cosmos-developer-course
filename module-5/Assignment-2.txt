Cross-Chain Use Case Development

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will design a hypothetical cross-chain use case within the Cosmos ecosystem. They will create a scenario where two independent blockchains communicate and exchange data/assets using the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol. This exercise encourages students to apply their knowledge of blockchain interoperability and IBC in a practical context.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Cross-Chain Use Cases (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the concept of cross-chain use cases and their significance in enabling diverse blockchain applications and interactions.
Task 2: Use Case Design (2 - 3 hours)
2. Instruct students to design a hypothetical cross-chain use case within the Cosmos ecosystem. They should consider the following aspects:

Scenario Description (20%):

Describe the scenario and the specific use case that involves two independent blockchains.
Blockchain Selection (20%):

Choose and provide details about the two Cosmos blockchains involved in the use case.
Interactions (30%):

Define how the two blockchains will interact with each other using the IBC protocol.
Specify the types of data/assets to be exchanged and the purpose of the communication.
Benefits (20%):

Explain the benefits or advantages of implementing this cross-chain use case.
Technical Considerations (10%):

Highlight any technical considerations or challenges that need to be addressed in the implementation.
Task 3: Use Case Presentation (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to create a presentation summarizing their hypothetical cross-chain use case. Presentations should cover the following:

Scenario Description (20%):

Provide a brief overview of the use case scenario.
Blockchain Selection (10%):

Introduce the chosen blockchains and their relevance to the use case.
Interactions (30%):

Illustrate how the two blockchains will interact using the IBC protocol.
Visualize the flow of data/assets between the blockchains.
Benefits (20%):

Explain the advantages and potential impacts of implementing the use case.
Technical Considerations (20%):

Discuss technical considerations and challenges in the implementation.
Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their use case designs and presentations for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their use case designs and presentations.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized use case designs, including presentations.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Creativity and feasibility of the cross-chain use case design.
Clarity and organization of the presentation.
Consideration of technical aspects and challenges.
