IBC in Action - Case Study Analysis

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will analyze a real-world blockchain project that successfully implemented the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol. They will examine the project's objectives, challenges faced during implementation, and the outcomes achieved. This exercise allows students to gain insights into the practical applications and impact of IBC in the blockchain ecosystem.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to IBC in Action (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the concept of analyzing real-world blockchain projects that have implemented the IBC protocol and how it can provide valuable insights into the protocol's practical use.
Task 2: Case Study Selection (15 minutes)
2. Provide students with a specific real-world blockchain project that successfully implemented IBC. Explain the context and significance of the case study.

Task 3: Case Study Analysis (2 - 3 hours)
3. Instruct students to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the provided case study. They should focus on the following aspects:

Objectives and Use Case (30%):
