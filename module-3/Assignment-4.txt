Querying Practice

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will engage in advanced querying exercises to enhance their skills in crafting complex queries and optimizing them for performance on a database system. The exercises will challenge students to work with real-world data scenarios and apply their knowledge of query optimization techniques.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Exercise Selection (15 minutes)

Provide students with a set of advanced querying exercises to choose from. These exercises should involve complex database queries and real-world data scenarios. You can create your own exercises or select them from textbooks, online resources, or open-source datasets.
Task 2: Query Implementation (1.5 - 2.5 hours)
2. Instruct students to select one or more exercises based on their complexity and preferences. They should write SQL queries to solve the chosen exercises.

Specific tasks for query implementation may include:

Crafting SQL queries to retrieve specific data from a database.
Using JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Aggregating and summarizing data using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
Implementing subqueries and correlated subqueries.
Optimizing queries for performance.
Task 3: Query Optimization (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Ask students to review and optimize their SQL queries. They should consider strategies for improving query performance, such as indexing, query restructuring, and avoiding common pitfalls.

Task 4: Documentation (30 minutes - 1 hour)
4. Require students to create documentation for their queries, including explanations of the problem statement, the SQL queries they wrote, and the optimization techniques applied.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their SQL queries, along with documentation explaining their thought process and optimization strategies.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correctness of SQL queries and solutions.
Efficiency of query optimization techniques.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
