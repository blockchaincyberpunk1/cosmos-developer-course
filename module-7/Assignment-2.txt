Proposal Creation

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will step into the role of a blockchain ecosystem participant and create a hypothetical governance proposal for the Cosmos Hub. Their task is to prepare a proposal document, outline its objectives, and consider the potential impact on the Cosmos ecosystem. This exercise helps students understand the process of proposing changes and upgrades within a blockchain network.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Governance Proposals (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the concept of governance proposals in blockchain networks and their significance in shaping the future of the ecosystem.
Task 2: Proposal Creation (4 - 5 hours)
2. Challenge students to create a hypothetical governance proposal for the Cosmos Hub. Their proposal should include the following components:

Proposal Objectives (20%):

Clearly define the objectives and goals of the proposal.
Explain why these objectives are important for the Cosmos ecosystem.
Technical Details (30%):

Provide technical details and specifications related to the proposed changes or upgrades.
Consider how the proposal aligns with the Cosmos Network's design principles.
Rationale (20%):

Offer a rationale for the proposal, explaining the problems or challenges it aims to address.
Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed changes.
Impact Assessment (20%):

Evaluate the potential impact of the proposal on the Cosmos ecosystem.
Consider how the proposal may affect security, performance, scalability, and decentralization.
Documentation (10%):

Ensure proper documentation and references for any research or sources used in the proposal.
Task 3: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Request students to submit their hypothetical governance proposal, including all components mentioned above.
