Cross-Chain Interaction Design:

Assignment Title: Cross-Chain Interaction Design

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will provide a detailed design document outlining how their advanced blockchain applications will interact with other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem. The design should include descriptions of use cases and data transfer mechanisms, emphasizing interoperability within the Cosmos network.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Cross-Chain Interaction Design (15 minutes)

Introduce students to the importance of designing cross-chain interactions for advanced blockchain applications in the Cosmos ecosystem.
Task 2: Design Document Creation (3 - 4 hours)
2. Challenge students to create a detailed design document that covers how their advanced applications will interact with other chains within the Cosmos ecosystem. Their design should include the following components:

Use Cases (30%):

Describe the specific use cases and scenarios in which cross-chain interactions are required.
Explain why these use cases benefit from cross-chain communication.
Data Transfer Mechanisms (30%):

Outline the data transfer mechanisms that will be used to facilitate cross-chain interactions.
Consider the use of the IBC protocol or other relevant technologies.
Security and Validation (20%):

Explain the security measures and validation processes in place to ensure the integrity of data transferred between chains.
Address potential security concerns and risks.
Interoperability Considerations (10%):

Discuss how the application will ensure compatibility and interoperability with other chains.
Consider the Cosmos Network's design principles and standards.
Documentation (10%):

Ensure proper documentation and references for any research or sources used in the design document.
Task 3: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
3. Request students to submit their detailed cross-chain interaction design documents, including all components mentioned above.

Task 4: Peer Review (1 hour)
4. Organize a peer review session where students exchange their design documents for feedback. Encourage constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Task 5: Revision (30 minutes - 1 hour)
5. Based on the feedback received during the peer review, ask students to revise and refine their cross-chain interaction design documents.

Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their finalized cross-chain interaction design documents.
Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Completeness and clarity of use cases and data transfer mechanisms.
Consideration of security and validation measures.
Documentation quality and references.
